# About me

**nakuldropchain/nakuldropchain** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building the Impact Miner and Impact Foundry Applications which are part of the Atlantis Suite of Applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Github, haha. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've never learnt anything about code, yet here I am.
